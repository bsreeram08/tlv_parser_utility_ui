# Project Progress

## What Works
- Project initialization with React + TypeScript + Vite
- Basic UI setup with Shadcn/UI components 
- Tailwind CSS configuration for styling
- ESLint and TypeScript configuration
- TLV test saving and loading using Dexie.js (IndexedDB)
- Keyboard shortcuts for save/load tests (hotkeys-js)
- Reusable SaveDialog and TestsDrawer UI components
- FloatingActionButton with Save Test action
- TLV Viewer with integrated save/load functionality
- Custom Tag Definition System (Phase 1 of EMV-123)
  - Data model for custom EMV tags
  - Database storage and retrieval via Dexie.js
  - Form UI for adding/editing custom tags with validation
  - Management interface for viewing, editing, and deleting custom tags
  - Navigation integration with main app layout
- Unknown Tag Handling (Phase 2 of EMV-123)
  - Modified TLV parser to display unknown tags instead of raising errors
  - Added visual indicators for unknown vs. standard tags
  - Implemented toggle to show/hide unknown tags
  - Added tag count display with filtering capabilities
  - Added "Define Tag" button for unknown tags to easily create custom tag definitions
  - Implemented auto-refresh when custom tags are defined from unknown tags
- Enhanced TLV Storage (Phase 3 of EMV-123)
  - Extended database schema with categorization, favorites, and metadata fields
  - Created EnhancedTestsDrawer component with improved UI for managing TLV tests
  - Implemented filtering by category and favorites
  - Added advanced sorting options (newest, oldest, name, recently used)
  - Visual indicators for favorite tests
  - Optimized load/save operations with metadata tracking
- TLV Comparison Tool (Phase 4 of EMV-123)
  - Side-by-side comparison of two TLV data streams
  - Visual highlighting of added, removed, and modified tags
  - Detailed view of specific value differences
  - Report generation in text format
  - Integrated with the enhanced storage system for loading saved TLV data
  - Tab-based interface for easy navigation between different comparison views

## What's Left to Build
- Cryptographic operation modules
- ISO 8583 message builder and parser enhancements
- Documentation for all utilities

## Current Status
- **Project Phase:** Feature Implementation
- **Completion Status:** ~60%
- **Current Focus:** EMV-123 TLV Parser Enhancements - Phase 4 (TLV Comparison Tool)

## Known Issues
- None identified yet, as the project is in initial setup phase

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Selected React with TypeScript as the foundation for type safety
- Chose Shadcn/UI for accessible component library
- Decided on memory bank approach for comprehensive documentation
- Adopted modular architecture for better separation of concerns
