## What Works
- Project initialization with React + TypeScript + Vite
- Basic UI setup with Shadcn/UI components 
- Tailwind CSS configuration for styling
- ESLint and TypeScript configuration
- TLV test saving and loading using Dexie.js (IndexedDB)
- Keyboard shortcuts for save/load tests (hotkeys-js)

## What's Left to Build
- Core data structures for EMV tags and ISO 8583 messages
- TLV parsing and manipulation utilities
- Cryptographic operation modules
- ISO 8583 message builder and parser
- EMV tag editor and viewer
- Navigation system between different tools
- Form components for each utility
- Data visualization for parsed structures
- Documentation for all utilities

## Current Status
- **Project Phase:** Initial Setup
- **Completion Status:** ~5%

## Known Issues
- None identified yet, as the project is in initial setup phase

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Selected React with TypeScript as the foundation for type safety
- Chose Shadcn/UI for accessible component library
- Decided on memory bank approach for comprehensive documentation
- Adopted modular architecture for better separation of concerns
